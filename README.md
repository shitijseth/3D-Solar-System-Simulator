**3D Solar System Simulator**

I started this as a personal project and ended up using this as a final project for a Python class. 


**3D model timeline**
- 2D model done in class for Earth and Jupiter including Sun for starters.
- Set the orbital and physical parameters and initial positions and velocities for the planets.
- Added a GUI using Tkinter with button
- Create arrays to store positions of planets
- Define run-time and step-size for simulation
- Use the Velocity verlet method to calculate new positions of planets
- Store the new positions in defined arrays
- Create arrays for frame updates
- Create line objects
- Set a viewpoint
- Update frames
- Give 2D and 3D properties to line objects
- Animation command
- Set axes off and set background black
- Added force from Jupiter
- Added factor of General Relativity
- Getting value for General Relativity from user
- Added a legend
